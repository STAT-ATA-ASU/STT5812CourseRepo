**Course Grading:**


* 39% of the course grade will come from quizzes (13).
* 21% of the grade will come from labs (3)
* 25% of the grade will come from two projects (10% first project, 15% second project)
* 15% of the course grade will come from participation (attendance, participation in discussion in-class and/or online).
* Up to 10 points may be added to your final course average for an excellent compilation of all assignments (quizzes, labs, projects) and class notes in a single hyperlinked `*.html` document. 

**Piazza:**

This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com.

**How To Get Unstuck**

If you have a course related question, please ask your question on [piazza](https://piazza.com/appstate/spring2017/stt/home).  Your classmates may have the same question or may answer your question before I can provide an answer.  Well constructed questions will elicit answers more rapidly than poorly constructed questions.  This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFaWxxzouCY&list=PLjTlxb-wKvXNSDfcKPFH2gzHGyjpeCZmJ&index=3) provides some background on asking questions.  This stackoverflow thread details how to create a [minimal R reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example/5963610#5963610). Please read [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Raymond and Rick Moen and heed their advice.
