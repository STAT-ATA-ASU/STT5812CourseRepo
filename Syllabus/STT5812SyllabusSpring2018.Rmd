**Course Description:**  

**Statistical Concepts and Applications II with Probability Modeling**---This course is a continuation of STT 5811. Topics include: an introduction to the design of experiments, exploring and modeling relationships between variables, including chisquare analysis, regression models, ANOVA, and logistic regression. Inferential procedures for each of these models will also be covered. Computationally intensive methods, such as permutation tests, will also be introduced. Statistical concepts will be developed through simulations, and applications will focus on statistical problem-solving and appropriate communication of results of a statistical analysis. Students will use two or more statistical software packages during the course. The goal of the course is to provide sufficient theory and methodology to prepare students to teach the introductory level statistics course. Prerequisite: STT 5811 or permission of instructor.


**Course Objectives:**

1.  Students will use a reproducible research work flow.
2.  Students will improve their technology expertise.
3.  Students will learn to apply and communicate the results of statistical learning techniques.

**Course Grading:**

* 25% of the course grade will come from quizzes (13).
* 25% of the grade will come from [DataCamp](https://datacamp.com) courses (8).
* 25% of the course grade will come from group projects (3)
* 10% of the grade will come from participation (attendance, participation in discussion in-class and/or online).
* 15% of the course grade will come from the final project.
* Up to 10 points may be added to your final course average for an excellent compilation of all assignments (quizzes, labs, projects) and class notes in a single hyperlinked `*.html` document. 

**Course Assignaments:**

Tentative assignments and due dates for the course may be found at [https://stat-ata-asu.github.io/STT5812CourseRepo/Assignments/STT5812AssignmentsSpring2018.html](https://stat-ata-asu.github.io/STT5812CourseRepo/Assignments/STT5812AssignmentsSpring2018.html)

**Piazza:**

This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com.

**How To Get Unstuck**

If you have a course related question, please ask your question on [piazza](https://piazza.com/appstate/spring2018/stt/home).  Your classmates may have the same question or may answer your question before I can provide an answer.  Well constructed questions will elicit answers more rapidly than poorly constructed questions.  This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFaWxxzouCY&list=PLjTlxb-wKvXNSDfcKPFH2gzHGyjpeCZmJ&index=3) provides some background on asking questions.  This stackoverflow thread details how to create a [minimal R reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example/5963610#5963610). Please read [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Raymond and Rick Moen and heed their advice.

**University Policies**

This course conforms with all Appalachian State University policies with respect to academic integrity, disability services, and class attendance.  The details of the policies may be found at <https://academicaffairs.appstate.edu/resources/syllabi-policy-and-statement-information>.


**Computers and Software**

This course will use the RStudio server  (https://mathr.math.appstate.edu/) that has the programs listed below and more installed.

* [R](http://cran.r-project.org) 
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) 
* [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
* [LaTeX](http://www.ctan.org/starter)

You must have an active internet connection and be registered in the course to access the server. To access the server, point any web browser to <https://mathr.math.appstate.edu/>.  Use your Appstate Username and Password to access the server.  A screen shot of the RStudio server is shown below.
