**Jan 16:**

* Go over syllabus.
* Become familiar with the Appstate [RStudio server](https://mathr.math.appstate.edu/). You will use your Appstate user name and password to log in to the server.  You must be registered in the class to access the server.
* Sign-up for free accounts on [GitHub](https://github.com) and [Rpubs](https://rpubs.com).
* When you register for a free individual GitHub account, request a [student discount](https://education.github.com) to obtain a few private repositories as well as unlimited public repositories.  Please use something similar to **first_name_last_name** as your username when you register with GitHub.  For example, my username on GitHub is *alanarnholt*. If you have a popular name such as John Smith, you may need to provide some other distinquishing characteristic in your username.  Please use the same **username** for your account on Rpubs. 
* Once you have a GitHub account, send an email to arnholtat@appstate.edu with a Subject line of **STT5812 - GitHub Username**, and tell me in the body of your email your first name, last name, and your GitHub username.  I will then manually add you as a team member to the repository in the STAT-ATA-ASU organization that has your name (**Last_name-First_name**).  This repository will be where you store all of your work for this course.  I will also change your repository to a private repository.
* Follow the directions from [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com/) to [Introduce yourself to Git](http://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html), [Connect to GitHub](http://happygitwithr.com/push-pull-github.html), and [Cache credentials for HTTPS](http://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html).
